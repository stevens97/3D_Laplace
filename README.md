# Visualising Electric Monopoles and Electric Dipoles

What this program does:
========================================

This Python script is based on an old Computational Physics project, in which Poisson's and Laplace's equations are solved for:
- An Electric Monopole.
- An Electric Dipole.

The electric fields of the aforementioned are then visualised in 3D with matplotlib.

Data Visualisations:
